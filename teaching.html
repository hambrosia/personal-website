          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p> Since 2010, I have taught at six schools ranging from European middle schools to top 10 American universities. My goal in teaching is to help students develop comfort and confidence throughout their learning experience. I want my students to become independent learners and to thrive in immersive situations. To this end, I try to simulate real-world settings by providing authentic cultural materials and designing collaborative exercises that resemble common daily interactions.  This is all part of my training as a foreign language instructor using the communicative approach. As a visual learner myself, I find that I am also a visual teacher and working with the blackboard is an important part of my approach to the classroom. I frequently use illustrative blackboard activities that require presentation, interpretation and collaborative negotiation of meaning.</p>
          <p> Some of the schools I’ve taught at have had massive budgets with state of the art technology, whereas others have had minimal equipment. A robust approach to foreign language instruction can thrive across this spectrum. When available, I use technology in the classroom to save time during input activities and provide authentic audio/visual media, but in many cases I find that a blackboard is most effective. Outside of the classroom, social-media and meaning-driven communication
            between students are great ways to capitalize on technological trends, without inflating the classroom budget. This is the goal of the German-language Twitter project that I initiated as part of the curriculum at Duke University. Students post and communicate as a team about classwork and social life in a fully target-language setting that provides authentic cultural resources. Looking forward, I’m excited to explore new topics, such as film, in the classroom.</p>

              <h3> German 203 </h3>
              <p>"Matt is one of the best language professors I've ever had. He's very dedicated and cares a ton about his students. Starting from scratch to learn a new language is tough, esp. at the pace these classes go, but Matt makes sure that any questions you may have are answered. He's very open to help outside of class and make sure you get it!" </p>
